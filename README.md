# ZOEL-Webshop

## Concept
Some family members are creating decorations, and they asked me if I could create a pretty simple "webshop" for them. They didn't want anything complicated, no payment possibilities, no database.

I thought it was a great opportunity to get in touch with React Native, so I said yes. I do not want to share the code. I do not know how nice it is, as I was never a front-end developer, but the real reason is that it may contain information that I would not want to share. I don't want to go through the whole project, so I will only share some screenshots of what it looked like.

I used the following video as a starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=377AQ0y6LPA

It was a great starting point, and as you can see, I hold the same structure and outlook. Maybe it looks like I did not add too many additional things; however, I had to implement many things in order to create from this fancy demo a real, working, and usable website. After I finished with the first version, which was basically the result of my practice with the help of the video, I deleted almost everything and started to build it up from scratch with my fresh knowledge.
